# Lab 2.5 - Pass the code quality gate and Apex test coverage

**Level**: 2 Contributor advanced

**Time**: ~25 min<!-- observed --> (observed: median 26 min, 11 learners, fastest 9 min)<!-- /observed -->

**You will**: get blocked twice by robots, fix both properly rather than around them, and learn to
run the checks before pushing.

## The situation

> **US-027 - Check several installations against panel availability at once**
>
> As a planner, I want to check a list of installations against panel availability in one go, so
> that I can fill a week of planning without opening every record.

An Apex change in `InstallationScheduler`. Two things will stop you, and neither is about your
metadata being wrong:

1. PMD, the Apex code analyzer, run for you by MegaLinter, on a query inside a loop that you are
   about to write by copying an existing pattern. It blocks the merge
2. Code coverage, because the new branch of logic has no test. It blocks too

Both are this project's choices, and both are what real projects choose: the analyzer refuses code
that breaks Salesforce limits, and the tests have to run 80% of the Apex in the org, above the 75%
Salesforce itself requires. Each one tells you what is wrong in a different place, so this lab makes
you meet them one after the other.

Admins, this lab is for you too. There is Apex in it, and you will not write a line of it: every
block is copied from this page and pasted into a file. What you practise is what an admin meets on
every real project, a Pull Request blocked by a code analyzer or by test coverage, and how to read
what the robots say before asking a developer for help.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 2.4](2-4-ship-reference-data-and-a-batch-with-deployment-actions.md) finished and merged
- [ ] Willing to read fifteen lines of Apex. You do not have to write any: every block in this lab
      is there to be copied, and what the lab is really teaching is how to read what the robots say
      about it

## Steps

### 1. Take the story

Goal: the User Story `US-027-schedule-by-availability` started, on `helios-dev`.
Refresher: [Lab 1.3](../level-1-contributor-basics/1-3-start-a-user-story-on-a-git-branch.md)

#### Do

1. **New User Story** **(2)**, under **Project Contribution Workflow** **(1)** of the DevOps Pipeline
   panel. Branch `US-027-schedule-by-availability`, target `integration`, org `helios-dev`

   ![The New User Story card of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-cards--new-user-story.png)

#### You should now see

- The User Story `US-027-schedule-by-availability` started, with `integration` as its target

### 2. Add the change the way people actually write it

Goal: a `schedulableOn` method in `InstallationScheduler`, on a Pull Request into `integration`.

The planner wants to check several installations at once.

#### Do

1. Open `force-app/main/default/classes/InstallationScheduler.cls`, the file the pipeline already deploys
2. Paste in the method below, exactly as the developer who wrote it first did. It goes at the end
   of the class: just above the last line of the file, which is the closing `}` of the class

   ```apex title="Edit this file"
       /**
        * The installations from the list that can be scheduled on the given day.
        *
        * @param installationIds the installations to check
        * @param wanted the day the planner wants
        * @return the ids that can take a crew that day
        */
       public static List<Id> schedulableOn(List<Id> installationIds, Date wanted) {
           List<Id> allowed = new List<Id>();
           for (Id installationId : installationIds) {
               for (Panel_Batch__c batch : [
                   SELECT Arrival_Date__c
                   FROM Panel_Batch__c
                   WHERE Installation__c = :installationId
                   ORDER BY Arrival_Date__c DESC
                   LIMIT 1
               ]) {
                   if (batch.Arrival_Date__c != null && wanted >= batch.Arrival_Date__c.addDays(PREPARATION_DAYS)) {
                       allowed.add(installationId);
                   }
               }
           }
           return allowed;
       }
   ```

3. Commit `InstallationScheduler.cls` from the **Source Control** panel
4. **Save / Publish**, push, and open the Pull Request

#### Why

It is the obvious way to do it, and that is the point. This one is a file, not an org change, so
there is nothing to retrieve.

#### You should now see

- A Pull Request into `integration` carrying `InstallationScheduler.cls`, with its checks running

### 3. MegaLinter blocks you

Goal: the query moved out of the loop: one query, whatever the size of the list.

The **Mega-Linter** check of your Pull Request is red, and the merge box reads **Merging is
blocked**.

#### Do

1. Open the MegaLinter comment on the Pull Request. The finding is under **code-analyzer-apex**:

   ```text title="Output"
   (Moderate)  pmd:OperationWithLimitsInLoop  force-app/main/default/classes/InstallationScheduler.cls
   Avoid operations in loops that may hit governor limits
   ```

2. In `InstallationScheduler.cls`, replace the method you pasted in step 2, from its
   `public static List<Id> schedulableOn` line to its closing `}`, with this one, and keep the
   comment above it

   ```apex title="Edit this file"
       public static List<Id> schedulableOn(List<Id> installationIds, Date wanted) {
           Map<Id, Date> latestArrival = new Map<Id, Date>();
           for (Panel_Batch__c batch : [
               SELECT Installation__c, Arrival_Date__c
               FROM Panel_Batch__c
               WHERE Installation__c IN :installationIds
               AND Arrival_Date__c != null
               ORDER BY Arrival_Date__c ASC
           ]) {
               latestArrival.put(batch.Installation__c, batch.Arrival_Date__c);
           }
           List<Id> allowed = new List<Id>();
           for (Id installationId : installationIds) {
               Date arrival = latestArrival.get(installationId);
               if (arrival != null && wanted >= arrival.addDays(PREPARATION_DAYS)) {
                   allowed.add(installationId);
               }
           }
           return allowed;
       }
   ```

#### Why

The deployment check next to it is green: the tests still run more than 80% of the org's Apex, at
about 81%. The code deploys, and it is still refused.

A SOQL query inside a `for` loop. Salesforce allows 100 queries per transaction, so this method
works perfectly for a planner checking five installations and throws
`System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries: 101` the first time somebody checks a hundred and
one. It will pass every test you write and fail on a busy Monday.

The fix is the one Apex pattern worth knowing by heart: query once, outside the loop, and index
what you get back. One query, whatever the size of the list.

#### Why a linter is allowed to refuse

The loop works in every test and fails in production on the first busy day. Nobody reviewing a
Pull Request reliably spots it, and the analyzer always does, which is why real projects make it
blocking. It only refuses findings of Moderate severity and above: the Helios code has none, so
the only thing that can turn this check red is what you just wrote.

#### You should now see

- `schedulableOn` in `InstallationScheduler.cls` with its one query before the loop, and no query
  inside it

### 4. The tests block you

Goal: two tests of `schedulableOn` in `InstallationSchedulerTest.cls`, checking what the story asked for.

#### Do

1. Push the fix. MegaLinter no longer reports the loop, and its check turns green. Now the deployment
   check fails:

   ```text title="Output"
   [sfdx-hardis][apextest] Test run code coverage (org wide) 76.92% should be greater than 80%
   ```

2. Read the verdict of the sfdx-hardis comment: **❌ Cannot merge into `integration`: code
   coverage 76.92% is under the 80% target**, and its **Apex tests** row reads the same
3. Add the tests below to `force-app/main/default/classes/InstallationSchedulerTest.cls`, the same
   way, just above the last `}` of the file

   ```apex title="Edit this file"
       @isTest
       static void schedulableOnRefusesBeforeThePanelsArrive() {
           Installation__c inst = [SELECT Id FROM Installation__c LIMIT 1];
           Test.startTest();
           List<Id> tooEarly = InstallationScheduler.schedulableOn(new List<Id>{ inst.Id }, Date.today());
           List<Id> lateEnough = InstallationScheduler.schedulableOn(new List<Id>{ inst.Id }, Date.today().addDays(60));
           Test.stopTest();
           System.assert(tooEarly.isEmpty(), 'The crew cannot be sent before the panels arrive');
           System.assertEquals(1, lateEnough.size(), 'A date after the buffer is allowed');
       }

       @isTest
       static void schedulableOnIgnoresInstallationsWithNoBatch() {
           Installation__c lonely = new Installation__c(Status__c = 'Planned', Crew_Size__c = 2, External_Id__c = 'TEST-INST-003');
           insert lonely;
           Test.startTest();
           List<Id> allowed = InstallationScheduler.schedulableOn(new List<Id>{ lonely.Id }, Date.today().addDays(30));
           Test.stopTest();
           System.assert(allowed.isEmpty(), 'With no panel batch, nothing can be scheduled');
       }
   ```

#### Why

Salesforce alone would have let it through, at 77% for its 75% floor: the project asks for more,
and the check job holds it to that.

The loop version was short, and the org carried it at 81%. The fix is longer, and every one of its
new lines is a line no test runs. You added a method with three branches and no test.

Note what the assertions do: they check the behaviour the story asked for, with a message that
says why. A test that only runs the code to lift a percentage is worse than no test, because it
makes the number lie.

The `Crew_Size__c = 2` on the record the second test creates is not decoration. [Lab 2.3](2-3-fix-broken-records-with-an-apex-deployment-action.md) made that
field mandatory, so any test that inserts an installation without it now fails, and a failing test
is a failing deployment. Every test class in the org has to be checked for this, and that is the
real price of making a field required.

#### You should now see

- The two new test methods at the end of `InstallationSchedulerTest.cls`

### 5. Run the checks before pushing this time

Goal: your tests run in `helios-dev` from VS Code, before anything is pushed.

Two round trips through CI to find two things you could have found on your own machine. Do it the
other way round from now on.

#### Do: the Apex tests

1. In the **Explorer**, right-click `InstallationScheduler.cls`, then **SFDX: Deploy This Source to Org**
2. Do the same for `InstallationSchedulerTest.cls`
3. Open the **Org Monitoring Workbench** panel: the **Org Monitoring** card of the Welcome page, or,
   in the sfdx-hardis side bar, the **Org Monitoring** section and its first entry, **Org Monitoring
   Workbench**
4. In the **Apex Tests & Security** section of that panel, click the **Apex Tests** card **(1)**.
   Give it a few minutes: a scratch org queues its test runs, and the first one of the day can take ten

   ![The Org Monitoring Workbench, with the Apex Tests card](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/org-monitoring--apex-tests.png)

#### Why

Apex tests run in an org, and so far your change only exists in the project's files: the Apex
in `helios-dev` is still the old version. Send it there first. **SFDX: Deploy This Source to Org**
is the Salesforce extension that comes with the extension pack, and it sends that one file to your
default org.

There are two ways into the panel, and both land in the same place. The card asks for no org: it
runs on your default org, `helios-dev`. It runs the org's Apex tests and checks the same coverage
threshold the pipeline checks, so you get the pass, the fail and the percentage without pushing
anything.

The percentage is the one of `helios-dev`, and it is not the one the check prints. The two batch
classes of Labs 2.3 and 2.4 went to `helios-integration` through the pipeline, and reach your
org only with a backpromote: until then `helios-dev` counts fewer lines, and reads higher. What the card tells you for sure is
whether your tests pass, and whether your own class is covered.

#### Why the banner at the top is expected

*Org Monitoring Not Present (CI/CD Repo)* means this repository is a delivery pipeline and not a
monitoring repository. The cards below it still work, against your default org. [Lab 3.8](../level-3-release-manager/3-8-monitor-your-production-org.md) is
where monitoring gets a repository of its own.

#### Why the Apex Tests tab is a different thing

A Pull Request in the **DevOps Pipeline** panel can show an **Apex Tests (n) (beta)** tab. It
runs nothing. It picks which test classes that Pull Request's deployment will run, and it only
appears on projects that set `enableDeploymentApexTestClasses`. Helios does not: it runs
`RunLocalTests`, every test in the org, every time.

#### Do: the linters

1. Push, and read what they say on the Pull Request

#### Why

Linters are the one check you cannot usefully run on your own machine, because they need
a container image the CI already has. That is two
minutes of waiting rather than twenty of setting up, and Level 3 shows the release manager's view of
the same report.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: the two commands behind those cards</summary>

The Apex Tests card runs the same command the pipeline runs:

    sf hardis:org:test:apex

and the linters, on GitHub's machines, run MegaLinter with the Salesforce flavor. If you ever want
them on your own machine, that is `npx mega-linter-runner --flavor salesforce`, and it needs Docker.

<!-- command-links:start -->
Command documentation: [hardis:org:test:apex](https://sfdx-hardis.cloudity.com/hardis/org/test/apex/)
<!-- command-links:end -->

</details>

#### You should now see

- The **Apex Tests** card saying your tests pass, and your own class covered
- Both checks of the Pull Request green after the push

### 6. Push and merge

Goal: the story merged, and `schedulableOn` in `helios-integration`.

Both green.

#### Do

1. Merge
2. Check `helios-integration`

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: where these two gates come from</summary>

The coverage gate is `config/.sfdx-hardis.yml`:

    testLevel: RunLocalTests
    apexTestsMinCoverageOrgWide: 80
    testCoverageNotBlocking: false

`RunLocalTests` runs every test in the org except managed package ones. The threshold is checked
org-wide, not per class, which is why one badly covered class can be carried by the rest of the
org for a while and then suddenly block somebody else's Pull Request. 75% is the Salesforce
minimum, below which no deployment goes through; this project asks for 80, and most real projects
set 80 or 85.

`testCoverageNotBlocking: true` turns the gate into a warning. It exists for projects taking over a
legacy org, and it is a temporary measure, not a setting.

The linters are MegaLinter, configured in `.mega-linter.yml`. The Salesforce flavour runs PMD
through Salesforce Code Analyzer on Apex, plus a flow scanner, plus the generic linters. It runs on
the whole repository for a Pull Request into a major branch, which is why a rule can fire on a file
you did not write.

The analyzer refuses because `.mega-linter.yml` says so, with
`SALESFORCE_CODE_ANALYZER_APEX_DISABLE_ERRORS: false`: the shared sfdx-hardis configuration only
reports Apex findings, and a project turns them into a gate. The linter is your team refusing. The
coverage floor is Salesforce refusing, and the project setting only chooses whether to ask for more. Neither of them checks that the code does
the right thing, which is the point: Salesforce is happy to deploy a hardcoded id with 100%
coverage.

</details>

#### You should now see

- `schedulableOn` in `helios-integration`, with one query outside the loop

## What you should see

- [ ] The **Mega-Linter** check green, and its comment without the loop of `InstallationScheduler.cls`
- [ ] The deployment check green, with coverage above 80% in the comment
- [ ] `schedulableOn` in `helios-integration`, with one query outside the loop

## If it goes wrong

**MegaLinter fails on files you never touched.**
It lints the whole repository for a Pull Request into a major branch. If a pre-existing problem
surfaces, fix it: you are the one who found it. If it is genuinely out of scope, the escape hatch is
a documented exclusion in `.mega-linter.yml`, never a blanket disable.

**Coverage is still below the threshold after adding tests.**
Coverage is org-wide. Look at the per-class table in the Pull Request comment: another class may be
dragging the average down.

**The Apex Tests card says there is no org.**
It runs against the org you are pointed at. Open **Orgs Manager** and check that `helios-dev` is
your current org, then run the card again.

**The Apex tests pass locally and fail in CI.**
Almost always data. Your dev org has records the integration org does not, or the other way round.
A test has to create the records it needs itself, rather than trusting whatever happens to be in
the org.
