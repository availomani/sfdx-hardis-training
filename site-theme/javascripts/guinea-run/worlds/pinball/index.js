/*
 * Pipeline Pinball, the bonus table of Guinea Run: it opens once the ten
 * worlds are done. The guinea pig, rolled into a ball, plays the pipeline as
 * a pinball table: the ramps are the branches, the Pull Request scoop starts
 * one mission per world, and Release day waits for those who finish all ten.
 * Three balls, extra balls to earn, and the table gets harder at each level:
 * the best players can last an hour.
 *
 * This module only puts the pieces together: physics.js (the balls), layout.js
 * (the table), rules.js and missions.js (the game), view.js and ball.js (the
 * look), autoplay.js (the player of the check). It is not a world of WORLDS:
 * the shell opens it from its own card (KIND = "bonus"), passes it held keys
 * and touches (hold), saves its game while it is paused (ctx.bonus), and
 * sends its result to the Hall of Fame on its own board.
