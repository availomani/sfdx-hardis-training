/**
 * Training > Level 3 > Publish my pipeline configuration.
 *
 * The release manager owns the pipeline configuration: what the DevOps Pipeline
 * settings wrote, the certificates of Add or Reconnect a Major Org, the .forceignore and the
 * package-no-overwrite list. Nobody pushes to a major branch, the release manager
 * included, and the branch protection refuses it: configuration goes through a
 * Pull Request into integration like everything else, and reaches the other major
 * branches with the next promotions.
 *
 * This takes the configuration files that changed, and nothing else, onto a
 * branch of their own, config/pipeline-<date>, pushes it and opens the Pull
 * Request. The release manager merges it once its checks are green.
