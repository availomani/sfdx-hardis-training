/**
 * Training > Set up my training environment.
 *
 * Everything that stands between one free Developer Edition org and a pipeline a
 * beginner can push a User Story through:
 *
 *   - the learner's own copy of the repository, with Actions on and the branches
 *     the pipeline uses
 *   - the Developer Edition org turned into a Dev Hub
 *   - three scratch orgs created from it: helios-dev to build in,
 *     helios-integration and helios-uat for the two stages of the pipeline
 *   - the Helios app and its data in each of them
 *   - integration and uat pointed at their orgs, and the CI credentials in the
 *     fork's secrets
 *   - integration and uat protected, so a Pull Request merges only once every
 *     GitHub Actions check on it finished green
 *
 * Why scratch orgs. Signing up for four Developer Edition orgs, confirming four
 * emails and connecting four orgs by hand is an afternoon a beginner spends on
 * something that is not the job. One signup and one connection is ten minutes,
 * and this command does the rest. The Developer Edition org itself stays out of
 * the pipeline until Level 3, where it becomes production.
 *
 * The limit to respect. A Developer Edition Dev Hub allows 3 active scratch orgs,
 * and only a few new ones a day. This command never creates a scratch org that
 * already exists and is still alive, so running it again costs nothing, and it
 * checks the allowance before asking for more.
 *
 * Design rules, the same ones seed.mjs follows:
 *   - Idempotent. Every step checks before it acts, so running it twice is
 *     harmless, and running it after a scratch org expired rebuilds that one.
 *   - It authenticates to one org only, the Dev Hub, and Orgs Manager does that.
 *     The scratch orgs are authenticated by the command that creates them.
 *   - It stops at the first failure and says which button to click instead. The
 *     course never asks anybody to type a command, so a failure has to end in
 *     something clickable.
